# Blog REST Backend
A Django REST API for managing blog posts with secure user authentication and author-based permissions.

## 🚀 Overview
Blog REST Backend is a fully functional API built using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
It provides endpoints for user registration, authentication, and complete CRUD operations for blog posts.  
Only authors can manage their own posts, keeping things safe and properly permissioned.

## 🧠 Features
- 🔐 User registration and login (JWT authentication)
- ✍️ Create, read, update, and delete blog posts
- 👤 Author-based permissions
- 🧰 Built with Django REST Framework

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework  
- **Database:** SQLite (default)  
- **Auth:** JWT / Token Authentication  
- **Language:** Python  

## 🎯 Purpose
I built this project to sharpen my backend development skills with Django REST Framework  
and to understand RESTful API design, authentication, and permission systems.
